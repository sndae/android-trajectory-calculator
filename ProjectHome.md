The project aims to develop a library for the android OS, which calculates the path followed by the android device based on the information provided by the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.

I'm still experimenting with the basics and trying to get a proof of concept.

You can download the code of the following experiments:

[Raw Sensor Plotter](http://code.google.com/p/android-trajectory-calculator/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftests%2FRawSensorPlotter): Plots the raw data of the accelerometer and gyroscope as an electrocardiogram.

[Sensor Logger](http://code.google.com/p/android-trajectory-calculator/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftests%2FSensorLogger): Logs the sensor raw data to the external memory as a CSV file.
